<h3>Discussion</h3>
Just looking at the relative position of the features, by comparing the original dataset and the one with the new engineered features, 
we can observe that Synopsis, Title and Genre roughly keep the same position. They share the same information and this makes sense. 
<br>
For the new numerical features (Ratings-n & Reviews-n) that were derived from the original Ratings feature, seems that Autogluon gives more importance for the numerical version. 
We can see that AutoGluon detects small changes related to feature importance, but these differences are not relevant as AutoGluon does a remarkable job extracting information from any kind of feature.
This doesn't change the fact that feature engineering has a very important role improving machine learning results in general when you are not using an AutoML model, like AutoGluon.
