<h3>There are a few Missing Values</h3>
 You always should look for missing values in your data during your Exploratory Data Analysis tasks (EDA).<br>
 How to interpret and handle these missing values depends on the circumstances related to the business problem that the dataset represents and how the data was collected. 
 Depending on this analysis we can drop missing values or imput them with new values. <br>
 As EDA is not in the scope of this course and there are only a few missing values, we will just keep them.
