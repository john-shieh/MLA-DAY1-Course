<h3>Data Matters!</h3>
 No matter which model you are running or if you are using AutoGluon or any other customized model, the truth is that you need the right amount of  data in order to adequately train your model. <br>
 In this example you can clearly see in the column <b>score_val</b> that, by offering more data to our model, the errors are smaller. <br>
 Note also that the times in the colum <b>fit_time</b> are higher, what is expected as more date requires more trining time.
