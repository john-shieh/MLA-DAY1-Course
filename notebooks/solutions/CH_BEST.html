<h3>There is no unique answer!</h3><br>

 The business problem defines how to balance the acceptable model performance (expressed by its score here) and the times involved in training and predicting (in general associated with costs and/or latency problems). So, a solution should balance these three dimensions: performance, training time and prediction time. <br><br>
 The business problem defines the acceptable minimum performance and the cost in time to pay for that.
 Looking at the leaderboard above, we need to balance the validation performance expressed in the column <b>score_val</b> against the prediction time expressed in the column <b>pred_time_val</b> (if latency is a limitation, as in real time prediction) or the training time, shown in the column <b>fit_time</b> (if the training time is a limitation. This is usually related to costs. For example, if you need to train a model for several days using expensive GPU machines).<br>
 <br> As an example, in the output above, you can see that <b>WeightedEnsemble_L2</b> model has similar performance to <b>CatBoost</b>. 
 However, <b>CatBoost</b> has significantly lower prediction time (`pred_time_val`). So, if latency is a problem here, <b>CatBoost</b> should be your choice.
